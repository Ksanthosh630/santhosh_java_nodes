 UNDER STANDING "main()" method
                       --------------------------------
                     public static void main(String[] args) 
		             {
                                --------;
                                --------;
				--------;
                              }
         
       Q) why we above method only write like this?
     A)
      1)public:
      ---------
       -->JVM Needs to Access It
      ---> The main method is called by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is outside the class.
     ---->If main is not public, the JVM cannot access it, leading to an error.
 
   2)static:
    --------
      -->static method can be called directly with the help of it's Respective "class name".
     & no need to creat an object for the static methods.
     ---->as main() is a static method because when ever we are running our java prg from the 
            the command java generated ".class file name".
     ---->so JVM IS GOING TO TAKE ".class file name" & respictive main() will be excuted.         
        
   3)void:
   -------
        --->every java prg starts with and also ending point is main() method.
        --->if main method is haveing any other  retuntype except void our prg
             will not be completed with main method.so main method returntype should be "void". 
  4)main():
  ---------
            ---->just a  method name
  5)String[] args:
  ---------------
              ---->java main method accept a "single" argument of type of String array.
               --->this is also called "command line arguments".
